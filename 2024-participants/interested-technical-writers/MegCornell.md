Hi, I'm Meg Cornell, a technical writer, technology educator, and technology enthusiast.

I believe that excellent documentation is essential for all digital tools and I'm motivated to assist open-source organizations in improving their technical documentation.

I'm particularly interested in projects that require restructuring, revamping, and expanding existing documentation.
